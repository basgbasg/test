# Librarian Training App
This application allows the user to choose between three tasks on startup: Replacing Books, Identifying Areas, and Finding Call Numbers.  This application was built using C# Windows Forms App .NET Framework 4.8 in Visual Studio 2022. 

## Getting Started

### Replacing Books
To effectively place books on library shelves, librarians must skillfully organize call numbers both numerically and alphabetically. The application will generate 10 random call numbers. Rearrange the call numbers in ascending order in the sorted section. Check if your ordering matches the correct sequence.

Users can verify if they have correctly arranged the sequence, review the correct order, and restart the task if needed.
