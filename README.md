### 
The players will then be presented with the alphabet. Each player has to enter a word with the
available letters in the alphabet list. When a player enters a word, the letters of that word get
removed from the alphabet list. Only vowels are not removed from the alphabet list. Before a
word can be accepted both players must agree if the word entered is valid or not.
